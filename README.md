Debian Image Builder for the Raspberry Pi 

The boards that are currently supported are;
* Raspberry Pi 4B (bcm2711)
* Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ (bcm2709, bcm2837, bcm2837b0)
* Raspberry Pi 0/0W/1/+ (bcm2708, bcm2835)

## Dependencies

In order to install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
sudo apt install build-essential bison bc git dialog patch dosfstools zip unzip qemu debootstrap \
                 qemu-user-static rsync kmod cpio flex libssl-dev libncurses5-dev parted fakeroot \
                 swig crossbuild-essential-arm64 crossbuild-essential-armhf crossbuild-essential-armel
```

This has been tested on an AMD64/x86_64 system running on [Debian Buster](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/debian-installer/).

Alternatively, you can run the command `make install-depends` in this directory.

## Instructions

* Make sure to adjust `config.txt` & `kernel.txt` with your own configurations before proceeding.

* Install all dependencies

```sh
make install-depends        # (cross compile)
make install-native-depends # (native compile)
```

* Compile the kernel

```sh
make kernel
```

* Prepare the rootfs

```sh
make rootfs
```

* Create a bootable Debian image

```sh
make image
```

* Clean up image errors

```sh
make cleanup
```

* Remove all tmp directories

```sh
make purge
```
